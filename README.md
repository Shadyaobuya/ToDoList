TO DO LIST APP

The to do list app is a simple web app that helps a user note down the activities for the day.
Once a user has the code in their machine and have Django installed, they can start the python server and navigate to tasks http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks/.

The app uses Python, Django, Html and Css. Django forms were also used.
